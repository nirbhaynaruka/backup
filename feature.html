                        The best way to fully understand something is by experiencing it yourself. That is why, after
                        educating the employees about different types of attacks and how they can defend themselves, we
                        provide them with a fun game where they create such attacks themselves and defend themselves
                        from the attacks generated by their peers. The gamification of the entire process enhances the
                        learning and makes it a memorable experience.
